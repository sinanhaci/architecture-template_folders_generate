# FLUTTER MVVM FOLDERS GENERATOR README

This extension is designed to create folders and dart files in the MVVM structure within the architecture-template that I have created.

Usage is very simple: right-click on the folder where you want to create a new file and select "New MVVM Folders," enter the name, and that's it!
